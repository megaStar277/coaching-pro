/* ---------------------------- FOR DEMO ONLY ------------------------------- */
// Remove this for production and remove line 25-27 from lib/output-colors.php
if (file_exists( CHILD_THEME_DIR . '/demo-functions/load-demo.php' )) {

  $selected_scheme = coaching_pro_demo_in_use( $selected_scheme );
}
/* ---------------------------- END DEMO ONLY ------------------------------- */

/*  ------------------- Notes about this theme  -----------------------*/

Default Images:
The front page includes three default images for Front Page Welcome, Front Page Call to Action and Front Page Offer. In the demo, the first two are images and the third is a graphic png outlined in white. All of these can be replaced with your own images and / or a solid background color.

This theme has no header-right widget area. That area is being used for primary navigation.

The theme has two areas for menus, the primary and footer menu areas.

The theme has built in SVG icons for both social media menus and for some graphic elements displayed on the home page. You do not need a plugin to display your social media icons. These can be added with menu links in either a widget area via a Custom Menu widget or in the footer menu. (see instructions for create that menu).

The theme has four pre-designed color schemes plus a fifth one that you can customize.

Accessibility support: The theme uses all the built in support for accessibility provided by Genesis plus additional features like automatically adding post titles to Read More links for screen readers.


/*  ------------------- Instructions to set up website like the demo  -----------------------*/

Setup like the demo:

Install the recommended free plugins and activate them first.

Import demo content (optional).

For your convenience, an export file of the Coaching Pro theme demo site is available to assist in the setup of your theme. This file contains the demo content for the posts, comments, and categories. If you already have your own content on site, skip this step. This step is for demonstration purposes only and you should not import data to a site with your content already there.

This file can be found in either of these places:

In the Coaching Pro zip file you downloaded, unzip the file and open the child theme folder.
The export file is in the xml folder located inside the child theme folder.

Or at this link: http://coachingpro.wpengine.com/wp-content/themes/coaching-pro/xml/coaching-pro.xml In your browser click File Save As and save it to your hard drive.
 (Click this link to download the export file for this theme.)

Learn how to use this export file in the How To Import The Demo Site Content tutorial.
https://my.studiopress.com/documentation/getting-started/demo-content/import-the-demo-site-content/

^^^^ Follow those instructions and substitute the coaching-pro.xml where needed.

Setup Home Page:

When you first install the theme, if you do have not set up any of the widgets for the front page, you will see either your blog page or a static front page based on your current WordPress settings.

To set things up similar to the demo site, you’ll need to create two pages. One as a placeholder for your home page (Front page) and one for your Posts page (the page that displays your an archive listing of your blog posts). Once you have both pages created, go to Settings -> Reading and edit your Front Page displays. Choose Static Page and assign the Home Page to Front page and Blog Page to Posts page.

Save your changes.


At this point if you have not added any widgets to the Front page sections yet, you will see a static page for your home page with a sidebar. You may use it like this or customize the front page by adding widgets.

Create a Menu:

Create a primary menu and assign it to Primary location. { Need to add more details here on how to set this up. }

Front Page Setup with widgets:

To activate the front page, you’ll need to add a widget to the front-page-welcome widget area.
