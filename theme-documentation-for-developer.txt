## Install Gulp

Next, youâ€™ll need to install Gulp globally (if you do not have it installed already). To check, just type `gulp -v` in your terminal window. If you see a version number, then you have gulp installed. If not, follow this step:

from terminal type: `npm install -g gulp`

## Clone the Coaching Pro theme repo:
[Coaching Pro repo on GitHub](https://github.com/brandid/coaching-pro)

Once the Child theme is installed, from the child theme folder in Terminal type:

`npm install`

At the terminal type `gulp watch`

This will fire up the Gulp watch task - it will sit back and watch for any changes you make to the SASS sass/.scss files, when you save a file the task will run, process your SASS files, and place them in the respective child theme folders.

Once phpcs is installed, you can install the WordPress Coding Standards:
